"""
The geometric progression is obtained by multiplying the common ratio `r` to the first term `a`,  successively. The ith
term of the progression is given by the following formula. `T(i) = a × ri – 1` Ask the user to  enter the value of `a`,
`r`, and `n`(the number of terms), and find all the terms of the GP.  Also, find the sum of all the terms.
